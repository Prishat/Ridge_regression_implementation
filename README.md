# Ridge_regression_implementation
Ridge regression on loan prediction problem using three variants of gradient descent optimization algorithm. 

1.Gradient Descent/Vanilla Gradient Descent-
  The update to weights in each epoch is done after fitting the entire dataset.
 
2.Stochastic Gradient Descent-
  The update to weights is done after fitting only one data point.
 
 3.Mini-Batch Gradient Descent-
  The update to weights is done after fitting one batch of data points.
